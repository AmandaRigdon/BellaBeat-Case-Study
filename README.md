Background Information

Bellabeat is a woman-focused company that creates high tech products centered around health. They offer high-tech products that aim to empower women by tracking their health through their activity, stress, sleep, menstrual cycle, and mindfullness habits. 
This includes a wellness tracker called Leaf, a wellness watch called Time, and a water bottle called Spring that helps to track hydration. Bellabeat also offers a subscription-based membership for guidance on nutrition, acitivty, sleep, and much more.

Business Task

Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they are looking to expand their horizons to the global smart device market. 
Urška Sršen, Bellabeat's co-founder and Chief Creative Officer would like to see analysis on smart device fitness data to find new growth opportunities for the company. 
She has tasked the marketing analytics team to analyze this data to gain insights on how people are already using their smart devices and get recommendations for how these trends can influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy.
With this in mind, my case study aims to answer the following:
1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy?

About the Data

For this case study, I will be using the Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data, a public dataset that's available on Kaggle. 30 participants were selected from a distributed survery via Amazon Mechanical Turk between March 3rd, 2016 and May 12, 2016. They consented to have their data shared.

This dataset is quite large, so I'll be using RStudio to perform my analysis.
